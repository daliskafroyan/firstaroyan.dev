              Hi there! I'm Firsta Royan ðŸ‘‹
            </h2>

                I'm deeply passionate about everything related to computers. My journey began in
                2015 when curiosity led me to try my hand at building a theme for Blogspot. Little
                did I know, tweaking layouts and experimenting with colors would be my gateway of
                learning software engineering!

                But my professional journey had only started from 2021 and I've been fortunate
                enough to bring my skills and enthusiasm to a variety of environments â€” from
                innovative startups to large multinational corporations and dynamic software houses.
